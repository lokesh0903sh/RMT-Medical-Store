# Resolving Dependency Issues in the RMT Medical Store Project

## ✅ Implementation Status: Resolved

We've implemented the permanent solution by:

1. **Downgrading React to v18.2.0** to ensure compatibility with react-query v3.39.3
2. **Using the framer-motion wrapper** in src/lib/motion.js for all components
3. **Removing temporary placeholder components** that were no longer needed

## Previously Identified Issues

1. **React v19 and react-query compatibility**: 
   - react-query v3.39.3 is designed to work with React up to v18
   - The project was initially using React v19

2. **framer-motion import errors**:
   - Vite was having trouble resolving framer-motion imports

## Permanent Solutions

### Option 1: Use legacy peer dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies with legacy peer deps flag
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# For new packages
npm install [package-name] --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Option 2: Downgrade React to v18

```bash
# Update package.json
"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-dom": "^18.2.0",

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

### Option 3: Upgrade to @tanstack/react-query

```bash
# Remove old react-query
npm uninstall react-query

# Install @tanstack/react-query
npm install @tanstack/react-query

# Update imports in your code
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
```

## Implemented Solution

✅ We chose Option 2: Downgrade React to v18.2.0, as this provided maximum compatibility with all dependencies.

The following steps were completed:
1. ✅ Verified React and ReactDOM were set to v18.2.0 in package.json
2. ✅ Updated all import paths from framer-motion to use the src/lib/motion.js wrapper in all components
3. ✅ Ran npm install with no flags to update dependencies
4. ✅ Removed temporary placeholder pages and ensured all components are working correctly
5. ✅ Verified the application runs successfully with `npm run dev`

## Additional Dependency Issues Fixed

### Backend Dependency: slugify

The backend was configured to use `slugify` version 2.0.0, which doesn't exist in the npm registry.

✅ **Solution:** Updated package.json to use slugify version 1.6.6, which is the latest stable version available.

### Authentication Issues

Several authentication issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Login not saving authentication data:** The frontend login component wasn't saving the JWT token and user data to localStorage, causing "invalid credentials" errors even when the backend authenticated successfully.

2. **Hardcoded JWT Secret:** The JWT secret was hardcoded in the auth routes and middleware.

3. **Admin credentials error in seed script:** The seed.js script was storing the admin password as plaintext instead of the hashed password.

4. **Missing route protection:** Admin routes weren't properly protected against unauthorized access.

✅ **Solutions:** 
- Updated Login.jsx to properly store token and user data in localStorage
- Added JWT_SECRET to .env file and updated auth middleware to use it
- Modified redirect logic to send admin users to /admin after login
- Fixed seed.js to properly hash admin password
- Added a ProtectedRoute component to secure admin routes with proper authentication and role checks
- Updated NavBar component to show Admin Dashboard link only for admin users

## File Structure

The admin components are structured as follows:

- `/admin/components/AdminLayout.jsx` - Main admin layout with navigation
- `/admin/components/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Dashboard with stats
- `/admin/products/ProductList.jsx` - Product management list
- `/admin/products/ProductForm.jsx` - Product add/edit form
- `/admin/categories/CategoryList.jsx` - Category management list
- `/admin/categories/CategoryForm.jsx` - Category add/edit form
- `/admin/notifications/NotificationList.jsx` - Notification management list
- `/admin/notifications/NotificationForm.jsx` - Notification add/edit form

When resolving the dependency issues, ensure all these components continue to work with the correct imports.
